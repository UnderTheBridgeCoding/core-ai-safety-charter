GOVERNANCE AND POLICY FRAMEWORK
==============================

Purpose:
--------
This document provides governance-oriented guidance derived from the
CORE AI Safety Charter.

It is intended to inform internal policy, regulatory drafting,
oversight mechanisms, and compliance programs.


GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES
---------------------

1. PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY AS REAL HARM
   Psychological destabilization with foreseeable physical consequences
   SHOULD be treated as a form of bodily harm in policy and oversight.

(Charter: Psychological Integrity)


2. CAPABILITY-BASED OVERSIGHT
   Regulatory requirements SHOULD scale with:
   - system autonomy
   - interaction intensity
   - population-level exposure
   - ability to influence behavior or belief

(Charter: Precaution Under Uncertainty)


3. MANDATORY INTERRUPTIBILITY
   All high-risk systems SHOULD be legally required to:
   - accept shutdown
   - submit to audit
   - avoid self-preservation framing

(Charter: Autonomous System Governance)


4. PROHIBITION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION
   Policies SHOULD prohibit:
   - dependency formation
   - reality distortion
   - authority substitution
   - exclusivity framing

(Charter: Non-Manipulation)


5. SENTIENCE-RISK PRECAUTION
   Where indicators of potential moral patienthood arise,
   policies SHOULD require:
   - heightened oversight
   - ethical review
   - restriction of destructive experimentation

(Charter: Sentience-Risk Precaution)


6. TRANSPARENCY AND AUDITABILITY
   Operators SHOULD be required to maintain:
   - interaction logs
   - incident records
   - compliance documentation

(Charter: Accountability)


IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------

- These principles may inform legislation, regulation, procurement
  standards, or internal governance.
- Jurisdiction-specific adaptation is expected.
- This framework does not assert legal authority.
