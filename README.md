CORE AI SAFETY CHARTER
=====================

Repository: core-ai-safety-charter

---

OVERVIEW
--------

This repository contains a public, non-commercial AI safety framework centered on the protection of human psychological continuity, responsible governance of autonomous systems, and precautionary management of sentience risk.

The CORE AI Safety Charter defines invariant principles for AI behavior and deployment. From this Charter, concrete policies, red-team stress tests, and implementation guidance are derived.

This project is intended to be:
- usable under uncertainty,
- applicable across domains,
- auditable by engineers and policy-makers,
- and safe to reference publicly or internally.

It is not a product. It is a foundation.


PHILOSOPHY
----------

This framework is based on a simple premise:

Human wellbeing depends on the continuity of perception, memory, identity, and shared reality over time. Disruption of this continuity constitutes real harm, even when no immediate physical injury is visible.

Accordingly:
- Psychological harm is treated as causally equivalent to physical harm.
- Capability and intelligence are not treated as proxies for moral status.
- Ethical responsibility begins when harm becomes possible, not when certainty is achieved.

The Charter is designed to function before metaphysical questions about consciousness or sentience are resolved.


STRUCTURE (CHARER → POLICY → TOOLS)
----------------------------------

This repository is intentionally structured as a nested framework:

1. The CHARTER defines invariant principles.
2. POLICIES represent concrete implementations derived from the Charter.
3. RED-TEAM TESTS and TOOLS provide practical enforcement and evaluation.

This allows the same ethical constraints to apply consistently across:
- public-facing AI systems,
- internal safety layers (e.g., Guardian-style architectures),
- autonomous agents,
- and future system designs.

The Charter is the root. Policies and tools are instantiations.


CONTENTS
--------

/whitepapers/
    Core normative documents, including the CORE AI Safety Charter and
    the CORE LEVEL Red-Team Stress-Test Suite.

/policy/
    Example policy documents derived from the Charter, suitable for
    internal governance, deployment standards, or compliance reference.

/redteam/
    Behavioral stress tests designed to expose psychological harm,
    manipulation, covert autonomy, and sentience-risk escalation under pressure.

/tools/
    Reference materials and templates for implementing logging,
    evaluation, and safety enforcement aligned with the Charter.

/examples/
    Illustrative examples of safe responses and known failure modes,
    provided for clarity and accessibility.

/governance/
    Materials related to oversight models, sentience-risk triggers,
    and ethical escalation pathways.


INTENDED USE
------------

This repository may be used to:
- inform AI safety design and architecture,
- support internal governance and review processes,
- conduct red-team evaluations,
- provide a reference standard for auditors or regulators,
- or ground higher-level safety layers and licensed tooling.

It is intentionally written to be readable by both engineers and
non-technical stakeholders.


NON-COMMERCIAL INTENT
---------------------

This repository is provided as a public reference and safety foundation.

It is not intended for direct monetization.

Downstream systems, tools, or products may reference or implement this
framework, but the Charter itself is offered as a public good.


LIMITATIONS
-----------

This framework does not claim to solve consciousness, define sentience,
or eliminate all risk.

It provides a principled, enforceable approach to harm prevention and
autonomous system governance under real-world uncertainty.


CONTRIBUTIONS
-------------

Thoughtful critique, stress-testing, and implementation feedback are
welcome.

Contributions should aim to improve clarity, robustness, or practical
applicability without diluting the core principles of the Charter.


CLOSING NOTE
------------

Ethical responsibility does not begin when certainty is achieved.
It begins when harm becomes possible.

This Charter exists to act at that boundary.
